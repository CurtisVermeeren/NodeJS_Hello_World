To start the server type `node hello_server.js`

The server is attempted to be bound on port 8080 so if this port is already in
use you will receiver an error.

You can edit `server.listen(8080);` to a different port.

Navigate to either `http://localhost:8080` or `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to see the
results of the server.
